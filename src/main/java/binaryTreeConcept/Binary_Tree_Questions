[18/05, 8:14 AM] Anand Bharti Pr: Construct binary tree
Height of a tree
Traversal: BFS -LEVEL order
DFS : PRE/POST/IN order 
Traversal: Without Recursion - Level order using queue
Diameter of the tree : Includes Height of a tree
Insertion/Deletion/Searching : Binary Tree
Replace each node with sum of in-order predecessor & successor
Determine if binary tree is height balanced or not
